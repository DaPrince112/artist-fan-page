<article>"Moonlight" is a song written and performed by American rapper XXXTentacion from his second studio album "?". The song was posthumously sent to rhythmic radio as the album's third single on August 14, 2018. 
    The song reached many chart positions globally, including a number 13 peak on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as a platinum certification following his death. It's therefore tied with "Falling Down" (with Lil Peep) 
    as his third-highest charting song in the United States, with both songs falling behind "Sad!" and "Don't Cry" (with Lil Wayne).</article>

        this was confirmed in November after the pre-order for the album became available.</article>
